# Implementation Guide

## Overview

This directory contains the structure for Option 1 (separate tools directory). The comprehensive conversion tools from the earlier artifacts need to be implemented to replace the current placeholders.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Replace Placeholder Files

The current Go files in `cmd/` are placeholders. Replace them with the comprehensive implementations from the artifacts:

#### `cmd/mdb_processor.go`
- Implement the full MDB processor with column mapping
- Add oil & gas specific business rules
- Include CSV/SQL export capabilities
- Add error handling and progress tracking

#### `cmd/cf_query_analyzer.go`  
- Implement ColdFusion file parsing
- Add SQL query extraction logic
- Include complexity analysis
- Add reporting capabilities

#### `cmd/conversion_tester.go`
- Implement comprehensive test framework
- Add unit tests for column mapping
- Include integration tests for full workflow
- Add performance benchmarks

### 2. Implement Internal Packages

#### `internal/mapping/`
- Column name normalization
- Oil & gas specific mappings
- Data type inference
- Business rule validation

#### `internal/validation/`
- Data quality checks
- Business rule enforcement  
- Referential integrity validation
- Performance monitoring

#### `internal/testing/`
- Test utilities and frameworks
- Sample data generation
- Validation helpers
- Reporting tools

#### `internal/models/`
- Data structures for conversion jobs
- Table and column mappings
- Validation rules
- Configuration models

### 3. Complete Makefile Implementation

The current Makefile has placeholder commands. Implement:

- `convert-mdb`: Full MDB conversion pipeline
- `analyze-cf`: Complete ColdFusion analysis
- `test-conversion`: Comprehensive test suite
- Integration commands for backend import

### 4. Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and mappings
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete conversion workflows  
3. **Performance Tests**: Validate with large datasets
4. **Business Logic Tests**: Verify oil & gas specific rules

### 5. Configuration Management

The configuration files are in place:
- `config/oil_gas_mappings.json` - Industry-specific mappings
- `config/company_template.json` - Company-specific templates

Extend these as needed for specific business requirements.

## Quality Assurance

Before marking implementation complete:

1. ✅ All placeholder code replaced
2. ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
3. ✅ Documentation updated
4. ✅ Integration with main project tested
5. ✅ Performance benchmarks passed
6. ✅ Business stakeholder approval

## Integration Points

### With Main Application
- Import converted data via PostgreSQL
- Generate migrations for schema changes
- Validate data integrity after import

### With Root Makefile
- `make convert-mdb FILE=database.mdb` (from project root)
- `make analyze-cf DIR=cf_app` (from project root)
- `make tools` (show tools help)

## Success Criteria

1. **Conversion Accuracy**: >99.9% data fidelity
2. **Performance**: Handle 100k+ records efficiently
3. **Usability**: Simple commands for common tasks
4. **Maintainability**: Clear code structure and documentation
5. **Reusability**: Works for multiple company acquisitions
